# Multi-Agent Hotel Booking Engagement
This application uses Apache Flink, Apache Kafka, and OpenAI to create a hotel booking engagement agent.

The multi-agent system automates and personalizes an email campaign to someone who is on a hotel website, looked at bookings, but hasn't booked. Apache Flink and external model inference is used to orchestrate communication with a series of AI agents, each responsible for a specific task in the lead management and outreach process.

The system is event-driven, leveraging [Confluent Cloud's](https://www.confluent.io/) as the backbone for real-time communication and data flow between agents. Each agent is a microservice that runs as a Flink job using the [Table API](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/table/overview/).

## How it works
TODO

# What you'll need
In order to set up and run the application, you need the following:

* [Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* [Flink v2.1](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/)
* A [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/) account
* An [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API key

## Getting set up

### Get the starter code
In a terminal, clone the sample code to your project's working directory with the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/thefalc/open-source-flink-ai-agent-experiments.git
```

### Setting up Apache Flink

* Downloads and install [Flink v2.1](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/)
* Update /flink/conf/conf.yaml setting `taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots: 4`
* Start the Flink cluster `/flink/bin/start-cluster.sh`

### Configure the AI SDR application

Go into your `hotel-booking-agent` folder and create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=REPLACE_ME
```

Next, following the [instructions](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/client-apps/config-client.html) to create a new Java client. Once the client downloads, unzip it and find the `client.properties` file. Copy this file into the /open-source-flink-ai-agent-experiments/hotel-booking-agent/src/main/resources folder.

### Setting up Confluent Cloud

The AI SDR uses Confluent Cloud to move data in real-time for communication between the agents.

### Run the application

1. In a terminal, navigate to your project directory. Run the app with the following command:
```shell
mvn clean package
flink run -c sdk.AgentJobRunner  target/ai-sdr-0.1.jar
```
2. In Confluent Cloud, navigate to the `hotel_insights_input` topic.
3. Click **Actions > Produce new message**
4. Paste the following into the **Value** field.

}
```
5. Wait for the agent flow to complete. If everything goes well, after a few minutes you'll have an email campaign in the the `hotel_insights_output` topic.
