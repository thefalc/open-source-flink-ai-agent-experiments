# Agent Experiments with Open Source Flink

This repository contains two multi-agent systems designed for processing inbound leads. The [multi-agent-sdr](https://github.com/thefalc/open-source-flink-ai-agent-experiments/tree/main/multi-agent-sdr) is built using the DataStream API and [multi-agent-sdr-table-api](https://github.com/thefalc/open-source-flink-ai-agent-experiments/tree/main/multi-agent-sdr-table-api) uses the Table API from Apache Flink.

In both, the singular agents run as Flink jobs and Kafka is used for communication and short-term memory.
